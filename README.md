# Restaurant-Manager2
I have successfully separated logic from both the CustomersController and ReservationsController by moving them into their own service classes. I also separeted toastr logic from its CRUD operations with a partial view named _NotificationsPartial so I would'nt have to repeat the process, therefore following the dont repeat yourself principle. At first, I thought of just moving some logic out from the controllers until I thought it would be better to move out any logic that uses RestaurantManagerContext into its services to improve efficiancy and organization. While I did have some ups and downs, I was able to use RestaurantManagerContext only in its services, separate from its controllers and call all its methods using only ICustomerService and IReservationService. Despite changes from moving logic from one place to another, the program should maintain its CRUD operations within the databases the same way as before. While I have added a few more confirmation messages, my main focus was separating concerns between controllers, services, and views this week, but my plan will be adding more notifications later on. Since I've used a partial view, all I would have to do later on is add notifications using TempData while making sure that partial tags are in the index views.
